MATH 115 Notes

V - Universal Quantifier "for all"  
3 - Existential Quantifier "there is"

Statements have 4 parts:
1. Quantifier (how much)
2. Variable
3. Domain (which set the variable belongs to)
4. Property (open sentence about quantified variable; tells what)

e.g) For every natural number n, 2n+11+15 is composite
      quantifier   domain         variable       property

e.g)  
For every integer x satisfies x^2 - n ≥ 0  
   ∀ x ∈ Z, n - n ≥ 0  
Then exists a real number x such that x - 7 = 5  
   ⇒ ∃ x ∈ R, x^2 - 7 = 5  

A statement is a sentence that is T or F  
Open sentence - non statement that becomes statement when a variable is replaced with a value.

Negation:  
¬(∀ x ∈ S, P(x)) ≡ (∃ y ∈ S, ¬P(y))
